## PO399 Final Project

This was a final project for PO399, a class on Data Analysis in Politics, taught by Max Palmer at Boston University.

Our assignment was to do some data analysis on the 2020 election, using some external data source; Prof. Palmer provided electoral statistics for all 50 US states and corresponding counties, while he tasked us to find an external data source. Eventually, I found the ["2020 Household Pulse Survey", a survey created by the US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html) to investigate the economic and social impacts of the pandemic, particularly, unemployment. The project aimed to see whether localized, low unemployment played a factor in a county's or state's votes for the 2020 election.

Please note that I did not use all the data from the survey, but only the data for Week 17 & 18, as those were the two weeks closest to the 2020 election that were available at the time.

I created several graphs for visualizing unemployment, electoral data, and the correlation between the two; each graph is available individually on its own or on the poster (PO399_Final_Project_Economic_Need.pdf).

I submitted the poster for our virtual showcase for this class.
